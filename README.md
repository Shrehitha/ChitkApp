**ChitkApp** is a community-driven mobile-first web application built to crowdsource, share, and preserve valuable Telugu household tips (చిట్కాలు) across categories like cooking, health, and home care.

This project is submitted as part of the **SOAI-2025 Internship**, with the core mission of creating an engaging "Corpus Collection Engine" for `viswam.ai` to gather high-quality, practical data in the Telugu language.

## About The Project

In every Telugu household, there exists a wealth of wisdom passed down through generations in the form of "chitkalu" or simple life hacks. This knowledge is often scattered and at risk of being lost.

**ChitkApp** provides a simple, accessible platform for users to:
1.  **Contribute** their own tips and remedies.
2.  **Discover** solutions to everyday problems.
3.  **Preserve** this invaluable cultural and linguistic knowledge for future generations.

The backend of this project serves as a powerful corpus engine, collecting structured, practical, and procedural text in Telugu to aid in the development of more capable AI models.

## Key Features

- **Browse by Category:** Easily find tips in Cooking, Health, and Domestic categories.
- **User Submissions:** A simple form for anyone to contribute their own "chitka".
- **AI-Powered Tagging:** Automatic tagging of ingredients and ailments using a Telugu NER model.
- **Community Moderation:** Upvote/downvote tips to ensure quality.
- **Share on WhatsApp:** Instantly share any useful tip with friends and family.
- **Low-Bandwidth Friendly:** Designed to be fast and responsive even on slow internet connections.

## Usage

Once the app is deployed and running, you can open it in your browser. You can browse existing tips by category, or use the form to submit your own. The "Share on WhatsApp" functionality is best tested on a mobile device.
